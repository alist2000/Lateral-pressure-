# Lateral-pressure-
In this file I calculate lateral pressure according to types of boussinesq loads.

We have a surcharge class and some functions that calculate lateral pressure and plot distribution of lateral pressure in depth.
for input you should enter depth of your point under ground and delta h ( The lower value of this number, the more accurate the calculations ) at first and for using every function define specifics values.
this code is under development . . .
